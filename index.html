        <h2 style="color: rgb(139, 0, 0);">The Discovery of Cocoa by the Olmecs</h2>

        <p>The Olmecs, who lived from 1500-400 BC, were likely the first humans to consume chocolate. Initially, they prepared it as a drink by crushing cocoa beans, combining them with water, and adding spices, chili peppers, and herbs according to Coe's Theory. The Olmecs started growing cocoa in equatorial Mexico, and over time, the Mayans (600 BC) and Aztecs (400 AD) also developed successful cocoa cultivation techniques. The cocoa bean held value as a form of currency and measurement, with 400 beans equating to a Zontli and 8000 beans equating to a Xiquipilli. During conflicts with the Aztecs and Mayans, the Chimimeken people used cocoa beans as a preferred form of taxation in conquered regions.</p>

        <p>Cocoa held great significance for these ancient civilizations, symbolizing abundance. It played a role in religious ceremonies dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec deity credited with introducing the cocoa tree to humanity, as well as to Chak ek Chuah, the Mayan patron saint of cocoa. <span class="nobles"> Additionally, cocoa was offered as a tribute during the funerals of nobles in these civilizations.</span></p>
        
        <p>As people migrated across Mesoamerica, cocoa production expanded, but the consumption of cocoa as a beverage continued to be a privilege reserved for the upper classes and soldiers in battle. However, during this period, the revitalizing and strengthening properties of cocoa became increasingly acknowledged and embraced by society at large.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2 style="color: rgb(139, 0, 0);">Discovery and Commercialization of Cocoa (16th century)</h2>
        
        <p>In 1502, Columbus caught sight of cocoa beans for the first time while on a visit to Nicaragua, but he failed to grasp their incredible potential value. It was only when Hernando Cortez, in 1528, consumed the cocoa drink with the Aztec emperor Montezuma and brought it back to the Spanish court along with the necessary brewing equipment, that the true significance of this "brown gold" was recognized. However, even at that time, it is doubtful that anyone could have foreseen its eventual importance as a global commodity.</p>
        
        <img src="images/historypage.jpg" alt="Cocoa tree" width="300" height="500" class="floatleft" >
        
        <p>After successfully defeating the native tribes and witnessing the decline of the Aztec civilization, Cortez increased his efforts to cultivate crops in New Spain, aiming to establish a profitable trade relationship with Europe.</p>
        
        <p>The Spanish court quickly became enamored with this unique beverage and customized it to their preferences by incorporating ingredients such as cane sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and pepper. Initially, Spain kept cocoa as a well-guarded secret, reserving it exclusively for their own enjoyment and keeping it hidden from the rest of the world. They were so effective in maintaining the secrecy of cocoa that when a band of English pirates seized a Spanish ship, they were unaware of the value of the heavy cargo of cocoa beans and decided to burn them.</p>
        
        <p>In 1585, the initial shipment of cocoa beans reached the Iberian Peninsula from New Spain, initiating the cocoa trade and leading to the emergence of the first chocolate stores. This marked the beginning of a new era characterized by a surge in demand for this enigmatic beverage from the Americas.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(139, 0, 0);">Key Dates</h2>
        
        <p><em>France, 1776</em> Doret pioneered a hydraulic technique that pulverizes cocoa beans into a smooth paste, enabling the initial mass production of chocolate.</p>
        
        <p><em>Holland, 1828</em> Chemist Coenraad van Houten developed a method for separating cocoa butter, which enables the extraction of cocoa powder. This innovation led to a more uniform and cost-effective production of chocolate.</p>
        
        <p><em>England, 1847</em> The English company Fry and Sons introduced solid chocolate to the general public, marking the first time it was made available outside of royal courts where it had been exclusively enjoyed before.</p>
        
        <p><em>Switzerland, 1830-1879</em> Daniel Peter and Henri Nestl√© separately created hazelnut-flavored chocolate and milk chocolate, while Rodolphe Lindt simultaneously developed chocolate fondant (fondu) during the same period.</p>
        
        <p><em>United States, 1893</em> Milton Hershey, a confectioner, discovered chocolate-making machinery at the World's Fair in Chicago and started producing chocolate at a factory located in Pennsylvania.</p>
